## Known Issues

There is currently a problem with deploying the Microsoft.Midi.GmDls framework package within the SDK. Because of this, the GS Synth is not currently usable. The code required for the reference framework is in MIDI.csproj, but has been commented out until the issue with deploying the framework package is resolved.
